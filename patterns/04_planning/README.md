# Planning Pattern

## Overview

The Planning pattern decomposes complex tasks into structured, sequential steps. The agent creates a detailed plan before execution, enabling better organization and error handling.

## How It Works

```
Task Input → Plan Generation → Step Validation → Sequential Execution → Result Aggregation
```

## Use Cases

- Project management
- Multi-step workflows
- Complex problem solving
- Research tasks
- Content creation pipelines

## Configuration

```python
config = {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "model_id": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    "max_steps": 10,
    "allow_replanning": True
}
```

## Example

```python
from patterns.planning.agent import PlanningAgent

agent = PlanningAgent(config)
result = agent.run("Create a marketing campaign for a new product")

print(f"Plan: {result['plan']}")
print(f"Executed steps: {result['executed_steps']}")
```

## Key Features

- Hierarchical task decomposition
- Dynamic replanning
- Step dependency tracking
- Progress monitoring
- Failure recovery

## Performance

- Planning time: 3-8 seconds
- Execution: Depends on complexity
- Accuracy: 85%+ completion rate

## Best Practices

1. Break down into atomic steps
2. Define clear success criteria
3. Implement checkpoints
4. Enable replanning for complex tasks
5. Monitor execution progress
