# Multi-Agent Pattern

# Multi-Agent Pattern

## Overview

Multiple specialized agents work together on complex tasks. Each agent has specific expertise and they coordinate through a shared communication protocol.

## How It Works

```
Task → Agent Assignment → Parallel Execution → Result Synthesis → Consensus Building
```

## Use Cases

- Research and analysis
- Content creation with review
- Complex decision making
- Distributed problem solving
- Debate and consensus

## Configuration

```python
config = {
    "agents": [
        {"role": "researcher", "expertise": "data_analysis"},
        {"role": "writer", "expertise": "content"},
        {"role": "reviewer", "expertise": "quality"}
    ],
    "coordination_mode": "sequential",
    "consensus_threshold": 0.75
}
```

## Example

```python
from patterns.multi_agent.agent import MultiAgentSystem

system = MultiAgentSystem(config)
result = system.run("Analyze market trends and write report")

print(f"Agent contributions: {result['contributions']}")
```

## Key Features

- Specialized agent roles
- Parallel and sequential coordination
- Shared memory and context
- Consensus building
- Conflict resolution

## Performance

- Coordination overhead: 15-25%
- Quality: Higher through collaboration
- Cost: Scales with agent count

## Best Practices

1. Define clear agent roles
2. Use appropriate coordination mode
3. Implement conflict resolution
4. Share context efficiently
5. Monitor agent interactions
