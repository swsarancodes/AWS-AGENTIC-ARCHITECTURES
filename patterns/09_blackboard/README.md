# Blackboard Pattern

## Overview

The Blackboard pattern provides a shared knowledge space where multiple agents can read and write information. It enables collaborative problem-solving through shared state.

## How It Works

```
Shared Blackboard ⇔ Multiple Agents Read/Write → Collaborative Solution
```

## Use Cases

- Collaborative research
- Distributed computation
- Knowledge synthesis
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Incremental problem solving

## Configuration

```python
config = {
    "blackboard_type": "memory",
    "max_entries": 1000,
    "access_control": "read_write",
    "persistence": True
}
```

## Example

```python
from patterns.blackboard.agent import BlackboardAgent

agent = BlackboardAgent(config)
result = agent.run("Solve complex problem collaboratively")

print(f"Blackboard state: {result['blackboard']}")
```

## Key Features

- Shared knowledge space
- Concurrent access
- Event notifications
- State persistence
- Conflict resolution

## Performance

- Access latency: <100ms
- Scalability: Good
- Consistency: Strong

## Best Practices

1. Use structured data formats
2. Implement access control
3. Version blackboard states
4. Handle concurrent writes
5. Clean up old entrieslackboard Pattern

Shared knowledge space for dynamic agent collaboration.
